John Jay has been playing drums since he got his first kit at 12 years old. He started practicing in his basement. He played Drum Set in the Lehi Jazz Band. He later formed a band called Loose Gravel.  Despite only knowing two songs, Loose Gravel gained some popularity in Holland. John Jay later joined a band called Killin' Time with Dick Covington and Jeff Hinton (Jeff later went on to form Joshua Creek... without John Jay). He played for several years in the Salt Lake area with Lance Perry and the Prairie Dogs. He also toured with David Edwards and Simple People. John Jay has been playing with the Shane Lee Band since 2001. His high harmonies and tight grooves lend a nice compliment to the Shane Lee Band sound.
