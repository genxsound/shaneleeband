## Shane Lee Band on Good Things Utah

In the summer of 2010 a cute couple hired us to play for their wedding. "Good Things Utah" decided to do a bit on what they would do if they couldn't do what they were doing. Angie Larsen decided she wanted to be a wedding singer, so she put an add out in the paper looking for anyone who was getting married that would be willing to let her sing at their wedding. That cute couple who hired us, answered the add and agreed to let her sing at their wedding. We met with Angie and she did a little bit featuring the Shane Lee Band. We then backed her up as she sang her song at the wedding. It was great. She was awesome. You can see the video [HERE](https://youtu.be/R8ABMF8m1hw)
