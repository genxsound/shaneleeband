Having grown up in the heart Southern California (Costa Mesa) where many genres were new and fresh, Jack was exposed to many guitar styles. But the rock scene was definitely worth exploring. Influenced by Michael Schenker, Van Halen and The Cars was enough to make him want to play guitar forever. Since 1979 Jack has been in many working bands playing in clubs and local parties and events throughout California and Utah. He has performed with bands like The Strike, Overboard, WaistDeep, 1969 The Band, and the Rusty Fenders. Jacksâ€™s unique searing-lead style has made guitar playing fun. Opening up a new exciting chapter, Jack was asked to join the Shane Lee Band. Jack is excited to be playing with some of the most talented musicians and people in the business. Rock on!
