JohnJay and I had the great pleasure of running sound for a fun ukelele group called the Naked Waiters at the Homestead Summer Concert Series. They played some fun originals along with their own renditions of pop songs. They're a cool group of guys and a pleasure to work with. Checkout their youtube channel [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/user/clarktholmes).
