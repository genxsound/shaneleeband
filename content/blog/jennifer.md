Jennifer has been singing since she was 4 years old. She has played leading and supporting roles in many musicals, including Oklahoma (Laurie) and the Sound of Music (Maria). Jen has been singing country music all her life. She even sang church songs with a twang. Jen started playing bass shortly after she married Shane and became a part of the band. Her vocal prowess is a great contributor to the Shane Lee Band sound.
