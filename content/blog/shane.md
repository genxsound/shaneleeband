Shane actually started out in music as a drummer. He got his first kit when he was eight years old. He started playing drums for his father's country band when he was 13 years old. Around that same time, Shane got a guitar for christmas. After his father taught him a few chords he started to teach himself how to play. He started buying guitar magazine down at the Circle K and learning every hair band riff he could. At age 15, when the lead guitar player in his father's band quit, Shane was moved from drums to lead guitar. Shane added a little bit of a rock and roll sound to the classic country his father played. After his mission, Shane continued to play guitar. He has played with groups such as: The Younger Brothers, Southern Highway, Legends of Country Music, David Edwards, and Jackson Cash. Shane also played bass for rock band Simple People and drums for gothic bluegrass band The Blackriver Brethren.
