Erin grew up in Oklahoma playing Bach and Mozart on the piano but listening to
Garth and Reba. She started playing piano at age 6 and continued through
college. She earned a degree from USU in Music Therapy (go Aggies) and believes
strongly in musicâ€™s ability to heal the body and mind. She was exposed to many
different instruments and musical styles in her education but nothing could
trump her love for the piano. She has dabbled in composing and has had a song
featured on an EFY album. She has accompanied countless musical groups at local
schools and churches. Erin began playing with the Shane Lee Band when asked to
accompany Jen on one song at a show and she was hooked!
