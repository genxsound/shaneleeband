text: "I just wanted to thank all of you for your fun, stellar, gifted, entertaining and wonderful show on Saturday night. I was truly sad to see it end, as were audience members. It is rare that an audience stays... and stays.... and stays....! That is a credit to your show. I think people would have stayed until sunrise if we let them. I am just sad that you weren't playing in a stadium getting millions for your performance! :-) You are all very talented musicians / vocalists / entertainers. What a privilege for all in attendance! Thank you for performing in the series. Can't wait to see you again!"
